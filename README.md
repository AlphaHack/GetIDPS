Use this tool to extract the IDPS from the PS3 NOR chip backup file. After the extraction the tool will generate two files: idps.bin and idps.txt on the same folder the bkpps3.bin files was selected from.


How to use it?

Just click on the 'Select backup file' button and go to the folder where the 'bkpps3.bin' is located.
